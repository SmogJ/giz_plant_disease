# Plant Disease Prediction

## OBJECTIVE OF PROJECCT
To develop a trained model that enables farmers to predict plant diseases based on image classification.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

## IMPACT
- Empowers farmers with data-driven insights for informed decision-making.
- Enhances crop yield and reduces disease spread.


## ABOUT DATASET
The dat set was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and the data set was uploaded by (Samir Bhattarai)[https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool] who stated in that the data set was recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this github repo. This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
